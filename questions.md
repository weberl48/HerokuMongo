How does an HTTP redirect work?

  a redirect takes you to a different page based on user action (form submit)

What's the difference between rendering and redirecting?

  rendering is displaying information on the current page where redirect will take you to a different page

Briefly describe what's happening with the "create route" (that is, the post to /albums that inserts a new document)

  The user is giving the browser some information and then the browser is passing that information to Mongo to be stored.
